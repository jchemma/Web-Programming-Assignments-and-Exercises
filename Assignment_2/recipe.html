	<h3>Introduction to Recipe Rating System Chart</h3>
		<p>
			In order to help you identify recipes that feature a high concentration of nutrients for the calories 
			they contain, we created a Recipe Rating System. This system allows us to highlight the recipes that 
			are especially rich in particular nutrients. The following chart shows the nutrients for which 
			15-Minute Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad is either an excellent, very good, or good source (below the chart
			you will find a table that explains these qualifications). If a nutrient is not listed in the chart, 
			it does not necessarily mean that the recipe doesn't contain it. It simply means that the nutrient is
			not provided in a suffcient amount or concentration to meet our rating criteria. (To view this 
			recipe's in-depth nutritional profilethat includes values for dozens of nutrients - not just the ones
			rated as excellent, very good, or good-please use the link below the chart.) To read this chart 
			accurately, you'll need to glance back up to see the ingredients used in the recipe and the number of
			serving sizes provided by the recipe. Our nutrient ratings are based on a single serving. For example,
			if a recipe makes 4 servings, you would be recieving the nutrient amounts listed in the chart by 
			eating 1/4th of the combined ingredients found in the recipe. Now, returning to the chart, you can 
			look next to the nutrient name in order to find the nutrientamount it offers, the percent Daily Value
			(DV%) that this amount represents, the nutrient density that we calculated for this recipe and 
			nutrient, and the rating we established in our rating sytem, For most of our nutrient ratings, we 
			adopted the fovernment standards for food labeling that are found in the U.s. Food and Drub 
			Administration's Refernece Values for Nutrition Labeling." <a href="">Read more background information
			and details of our rating system.</a>
